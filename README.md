# graff

This project is meant to be a way to play a similar game to the old Yahoo! Graffiti that doesn't exist anymore.

Things still left to do:
  * Add a timer
  * Add nickname/cookie storing
  * Add list of who is online
  * Add turns
  * Add teams/no team game modes
  * Add word list selection
  * Add scoring - 50 pts/word, if all 10 maybe add remaining time
