                | Extra characters are ok, too. For example "a bunch of bees" is a correct guess for "bee".

              | As the person drawing, if a guess is close you can click on their message in the guessing box to highlight it to let the guesser(s) know they are on the right track.

        button.btn.btn-primary(data-dismiss='modal') Got it!
